Pandas is the library to use to structurise the data from the 
unstructured data

Intelligence is composed of learning,reasoning and Intelligence

Applications of Machine Learning 

Virtual Programming Assistants adn Recommendation Systems

Object Recognition and Face detection

Mining the big data 

(Analytics and stock with this pattern tend to go up)

Classification and clustering of data 

(fraud detection and sequence mining)

Data understanding and data mining 

Experience comes from the past experience.

Searching, Reducing and filtering of important data from the unstructured data is known as data mining.

AI is the superset of all these fields 

Machine Learning has two concepts in it 

Neural Networks and the deep learning 

Solving of an uncertain problem

When to use the SUPERVISED ML and when to use UNSUPERVISED ML 

1. Observe
2.Interpret(Sense and understand)
3. Evaluate Generating Hypothesis
4. Modelling 

Data Collection

Data(features) 

COST FUNCTION  is the error between the target value and the original value. 

Minimise the cost function which is target value - original value 

MEAN SQUARED ERROR = SQUARE(COST FUNCTION)

Data Split 

Splitting the dataset into the training set and the testing set.

Training the system (80% of the dataset) 

Testing the model to predict its statistical power and how well it understood the  correlations

Model storage and reusing of the model 

ML Applications

Prediction
Classification
Speech Recognition 

Supervised learning is for labelled data 

Prediction and Classification(Supervised learning algorithm)

Data is discrete Always use the classification technique to analyse the data

Data set is continuous Use Prediction

Supervised Task Driven

Unsupervised Learning (Data Driven)
No labels associated with data points.These machine learning algos organise the data into a group of clusters
to describe its structure and make complex data look simple

Supervised learning is known as the prediction learning.

Classification can be single class or multiple class

Packages and Classes

IDE - Spyder and Anaconda Notebook Jupyter

To run a new instance of the jupyter notebook, use ipython notebook command or the jupyter notebook command

Numpy is a scientific Numerical computation library for working with the matrices

numpy scipy python matplotlib seaborn libraries that we use in machine learning


Intro to python programming language

List [1,2,32,3,4,54,"rfasfsd"] are mutable we can mutate the elements at the runtime

Tuple (1,2,33,3,3,4,54,2,23) 

Dictionary is just like the object literal in javascript {
    key1 : value1,
    key2 : value2,
    key3 : value3
}
