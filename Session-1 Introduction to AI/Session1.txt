Searching, Reducing and filtering of important data from the unstructured data is known as data mining.

AI is the superset of all these fields 

Machine Learning has two concepts in it 

Neural Networks and the deep learning 

Solving of an uncertain problem

When to use the SUPERVISED ML and when to use UNSUPERVISED ML 

1. Observe
2.Interpret(Sense and understand)
3. Evaluate Generating Hypothesis
4. Modelling 

Data Collection

Data(features) 

COST FUNCTION  is the error between the target value and the original value. 

Minimise the cost function which is target value - original value 

MEAN SQUARED ERROR = SQUARE(COST FUNCTION)
